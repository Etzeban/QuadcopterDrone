<h1>Quadcopter Drone</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The students are invited to form a group of 5-6 members from different programs and to complete a design project. I responsible for designing the drone's parts using SolidWorks, wiring diagram and PCB using EsyEDA. I support in the drone hardware layout, procurement, testing, presentation demo, and writing reports. At the end of the semester, we successfully built a remote controled quadcopter with basic flying maneuvers.
